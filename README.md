The URL Shortener Service is a Java-based Spring Boot application that converts long URLs into short, shareable links using Base62 encoding. It stores URL mappings in the Mysql database, tracks the number of times each short URL is accessed, and supports automatic redirection to the original link. The API is RESTful.
